# Babysitter
UI for the Babysitter service for [cudl.finance](https://cudl.finance). 

1. Keeps your pet alive without your daily involvement.
2. Saves time by automating mining/feeding multiple pets.
3. Saves money by batching transactions. You will spend less gas vs multiple transactions on multiple pets.
4. The contract can pull tokens from your wallet if given approval. Useful for low level pets who earn less Cudl than the food cost.
5. You can still mine/feed as normal and rely on it only as insurance incase you forget to feed your pet.
6. All without any security risks. The contract utilizes the caretaker feature, so it only has permissions to feed and mine your pet. 
7. Small fee on Cudl mined.
